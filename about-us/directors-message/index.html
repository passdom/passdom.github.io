        <p>Laozi was a legendary philosopher of ancient China said, “The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step”. So also Martin Luther King, Jr has exclaimed, “Take the first step in faith. You don’t have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step”. Yes, the journey of PASS affirms the above said sayings. It all began in the year 1992 when we had a humble beginning in the journey of social development works among the poor people by establishment of Marie Kirana crèche for the children of domestic mothers in neighborhood slums of Indiranagar and other slums of Bangalore city. That was our first step among the blessed poor that gradually enabled us to start an independent social work center called Poussepin Alliance for Social Services (PASS) which is our extension of charism of Blessed Marie Pussepin the founder of Dominican Sisters of the Presentation.</p>
<p>Ever since its inception, we are working among children through crèche, annual education aid, evening tuition, formation of children’s parliament, Gnana Koota, exposure visits, trainings, and awareness programmes to enable poor children towards holistic education. So also, we are empowering the urban poor women through animation, formation of Self help groups, health programmes, camps, international women’s day, Christmas day, children’s day, credit saving in SHGs, training, and capacity building of women, promoting income generating activities through micro credit facilities, and other community development programmes.</p>
<p>Looking back to these years, we have a great sense of happiness and satisfaction for the great transformation we see in these women and children. As many as 179 poor children are assisted for continuing their formal school education in Resurrection school, Indiranagar, formed 15 child’s parliament and building capacity of children, facilitated formation of 31 women’s self help groups (SHGs) consisting of 416 members with total saving of Rs.13,23,868/-, besides, good numbers of sangha women have accessed Rs.200000/- towards productive income generating activities such as petty shop, chicken kabab stall, flower sale, tailoring, scrap shop, old paper mart, vegetable sale, chips sale, etc.</p>
<p>The journey has not ended, it just started. All these achievements were possible because of the great patronage of our provincial &amp; community superiors, co sisters, and most importantly, our dear donors, individual sponsors, well wishers, volunteers, and friends. Your gigantic support, I seek to continue to change the lives of the less privileged and the marginalized for which I strongly believe, abundant God’s’ blessings and protection. I am ever thankful to you all.</p>
